# MTVprocess3D

Multi-channel total variation (MTV) denoising or super-resolution, of magnetic resonance (MR) images. 

Requires that the SPM software, and our Auxiliary toolbox, is on the MATLAB path. SPM is available from
https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/ and the Auxiliary toolbox from https://github.com/WTCN-computational-anatomy-group/auxiliary-functions. If you put the Auxiliary toolbox into the same folder as this code, then it should be added to the MATLAB path automatically.

The general principles of the methods are described in the following paper:
